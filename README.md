The short version

Where On Earth (WOE) data for countries smushed up with Natural Earth (NE) 1:10m
data for "admin1" (states, provinces, regions and so on) areas. That's fancy
talk for "polygons".

The longer version
--

It's still a bit of a moving target, specifically formatting and normalizing ket
names in the `properties` hash. For example, all the NE property keys are
prefixed with `ne:`. Most but not all the records have NE geometries associated
with them.

Suggestions and gentle cluebats are absolutely welcome.

The long version

I still need to write it.
