states-geocode.csv
--

A vanilla CSV file mapping Natural Earth (NE) name, three-letter ISO code and
FIPS-1 code to Where On Earth ID. Note: _This is not a complete mapping_. It is
the result of geocoding the NE records using the Flickr API and limiting
possible results to only those places with (WOE) place type of 'state'.
